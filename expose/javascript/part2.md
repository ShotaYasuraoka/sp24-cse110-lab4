1. 3 because prices has three entries and the for loop runs three times, thus i = 0 is added by 1 three tiems.

2. 150 because the third input of prices is 300 and it is discounted by 50% inside the for loop, and it becomes the final value of discountedPrice.

3. 150 because the third input of prices is 300 and it is discounted by 50% inside the for loop, and it becomes the final value of finalPrice.

4. This function returns [50, 100, 150] because each input is discounted by 50% and pushed into discounted array.

5. The code causes an error because the let variable "i" is defined inside of the for loop and thus cannot be accessed from outside of the loop.
   
6. The code causes an error because the let variable "discountedPrice" is defined inside of the for loop and thus cannot be accessed from outside of the loop.

7. 150 because the third input of prices is 300 and it is discounted by 50% inside the for loop, and it becomes the final value of finalPrice. Note that finalPrice is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accesssed by console.log().

8. This function returns [50, 100, 150] because each input is discounted by 50% and pushed into discounted array. Note that const discounted is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accesssed by the return statement.
   
9. The code causes an error because the let  variable "i" is defined inside of the for loop and thus cannot be accessed from outside of the loop.

10. 3 because prices is the array that has three entries, thus its length is three. Note that const length is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accessed by console.log().

11. This function returns [50, 100, 150] because each input is discounted by 50% and pushed into discounted array. Note that const discounted is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accesssed by the return statement.

12. 
A. student.name;
B. student['Grad Year'];
C. student.greeting();
D: student['Favorite Teacher'].name;
E: student.courseLoad[0];

13. 
A. '32'. number 2 is converted into a string.
B. 1. There's no '-' operation for string, so JS converts '3' into a number, and show the result of 3 - 2 in string.
C. 3. null is treated as 0 in numerical addition.
D. '3null'. null is converted to a string and connected with '3'.
E. 4. true is converted to 1 in numerical addition.
F. 0. false and null are both converted to 0 in numerical addition.
G. '3undefined'. undefined is converted to the string and connected to 3.
H. NaN. There's no '-' operation for string, and undefined cannot be converted to a number. 

14. 
A. true. string '2' is converted to a number and 2 > 1 is true.
B. false. When comparing two strings, '2' appears later than '1', thus '2' is greater than '12'.
C. true. == allows type coercion, converting string '2' to the number.
D. false. === doesn't allow type coercion, and string and number are different types.
E. false. true is converted to 1, and 1 is not equal to  2.
F. true. Boolean(2) is true and the two operands have the same type and value.

15.  While == only checks value and does type coercion if needed, === checks the equality of both the value and the type, thus no type coercion is performed.

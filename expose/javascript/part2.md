1. 3 because prices has three entries and the for loop runs three times, thus i = 0 is added by 1 three tiems.

2. 150 because the third input of prices is 300 and it is discounted by 50% inside the for loop, and it becomes the final value of discountedPrice.

3. 150 because the third input of prices is 300 and it is discounted by 50% inside the for loop, and it becomes the final value of finalPrice.

4. This function returns [50, 100, 150] because each input is discounted by 50% and pushed into discounted array.

5. The code causes an error because the let variable "i" is defined inside of the for loop and thus cannot be accessed from outside of the loop.
   
6. The code causes an error because the let variable "discountedPrice" is defined inside of the for loop and thus cannot be accessed from outside of the loop.

7. 150 because the third input of prices is 300 and it is discounted by 50% inside the for loop, and it becomes the final value of finalPrice. Note that finalPrice is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accesssed by console.log().

8. This function returns [50, 100, 150] because each input is discounted by 50% and pushed into discounted array. Note that const discounted is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accesssed by the return statement.
   
9. The code causes an error because the let  variable "i" is defined inside of the for loop and thus cannot be accessed from outside of the loop.

10. 3 because prices is the array that has three entries, thus its length is three. Note that const length is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accessed by console.log().

11. This function returns [50, 100, 150] because each input is discounted by 50% and pushed into discounted array. Note that const discounted is defined outside of the for loop, so it can be accesssed by the return statement.
